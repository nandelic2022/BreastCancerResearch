In this repository you can find the equations that were obtained in the research: 
Anđelić, N., & Baressi Šegota, S. (2023). Development of Symbolic Expressions Ensemble for Breast Cancer Type Classification Using Genetic Programming Symbolic Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier. Cancers, 15(13), 3411.
or you can check out the GPSC code that was used to obtain these equations (symbolic expressions).
